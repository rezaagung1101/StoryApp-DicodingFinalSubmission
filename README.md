# StoryApp - DicodingFinalSubmission

##Noteworthy: 
###This project was created as the final submission of Intermediate Android course on Dicoding.

This application is an application that is used to upload stories using the camera or image selection feature in the gallery. In addition, in the paging branch I also added a feature to provide the current location when uploading a story, as well as to find out the location of other users who uploaded their stories.

###Use the code in this project wisely as a reference, and DO NOT PLAGIATE because it will harm yourself!
